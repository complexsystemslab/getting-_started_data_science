Resources to teach yourself data science. These resources are suitable for students and working professionals, especially in low and medium income countries (LMICs). 

These resources give you the absolute basics to teach yourself data science at home. I assume you have a basic computer, an internet connection and an immense drive to learn!

* Learn programming (especially C and/or Python and/or R)

* Learn basic statistics

* Start an open source open data science project on a topic you are really interested in. This will become your data science portfolio. For example, see the following:

* If you get stuck conceptually or want to learn the basics of statistics, you can consult the free Introduction to Statistical Learning (ISLR) book
