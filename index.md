## Welcome to GitHub Pages


Resources to get started in data science and teach yourself data science. These resources are suitable for students in low and medium income countries (LMIC). 

These resources give you the absolute basics to teach yourself data science at home. I assume you have a computer and an internet connection.

* Learn programming (especially C and/or Python and/or R)

    * https://github.com/neelsoumya/programming_resources 

* Learn statistics

    * https://github.com/neelsoumya/basic_statistics


* Start an open source open data project on a topic you are really interested in. For example, see the following:

    * https://github.com/neelsoumya/public_open_source_data_science



* If you get stuck or want to learn the basics consult the ISLR book

    * https://www.statlearning.com/s/ISLRSeventhPrinting.pdf



You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/neelsoumya/getting-_started_data_science/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/neelsoumya/getting-_started_data_science/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
